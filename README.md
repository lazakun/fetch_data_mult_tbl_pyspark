Project Tasks:
- query multiple large similar (same schema) tables residing in a MSSQL server database
- the query logic would be shared as an SQL script in a text format
- the final output of the query should  identify the tables where the data resides
- the final output of the query should be copied (overwrite option) to PostgreSQL DB
- airflow should be used to orchestrate and schedule the pipeline
